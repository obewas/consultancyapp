              <h5>Historical Background</h5>
              <p>Oxstar was established in March 2018 during the International Research and Training Workshop held at the Golden Tulip Hotel Dar es Salaam in Tanzania sponsored by the Queen’s University Belfast, Northern Ireland UK to strengthen the capacity of African scholars on crucial research gaps in the continent. Thereafter, the Oxstar Co-founders have been leveraging the capacity of academic institutions, Non-governmental organizations, government agencies and private enterprises to utilize scientific research to solve bottlenecks facing most African countries. Through this humble origin, Oxstar was formalized and legally registered under the Companies Act, 2015 of Kenya (No. PVT-9XUG95VV) as a private limited company that deals in research & development activities in Kenya and internationally. </p>
